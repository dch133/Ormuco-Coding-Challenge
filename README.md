Q1: Find if two coordinate sets overlap on the x-axis

Covers positive and negative numbers as cases

-----------------------------------
Q2: Compare software version number (float-string) and show test cases

Assume that the input format is  X.X only (X is an int)

Tester: Compares if a string is bigger, smaller or same as the other.
There should not be negative version number but the code allows it. 

Hardcoded Case: 0.0 is the same as -0.0

-----------------------------------
Q3: Geo Distributed LRU (Least Recently Used) cache with time expiration

Assumptions: Cache randomly adds strings (str1 to str10) for 20 iterations and logs the changes in the cache.

Geo Distribution not implemented.

This code can by actually writing the Cache in C then importing the binaries into Python. ,
